  Going through the book Python Crash Course 3rd Edition chapter by chapter. I'm using Jupyter Notebook files to keep the code all in one section. The first 2 chapters were all done in 1 notebook; however, starting from chapter 3 forward, they will be in separate notebooks.

  This is also a means of understanding and using Git with VS Code.
